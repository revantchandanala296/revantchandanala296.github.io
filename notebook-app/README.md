This is the project structure that I generally use while building apps.

1. You can type in any of the 5 pages and it will persist the data even after a browser refresh.
2. I used AngularJS framework since it was a single page application.
3. I have included hammer.js library which recognizes gesture so that you can swipe from one page to another.
4. I used gulp which automates compressing js and css tasks.
5. And it might be not responsive but was not an ask.
